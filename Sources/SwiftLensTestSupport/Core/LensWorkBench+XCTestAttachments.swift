    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - name: Used as base name for all hierarchy-related attachments.
    ///   - lifetime: `.keepAlways` by default; can be `.deleteOnSuccess` for CI.

    /// üì∏ Attaches a snapshot of the current UI state to the test result.
    ///
    /// This includes:
    /// - A screenshot of the visible window (`UIImage`).
    /// - A `.plist` file representing the captured view hierarchy (`LensCapture`).
    /// - A `.txt` dump of the same hierarchy for human-readable inspection.
    ///
    /// Useful for debugging failed expectations, layout issues, or unexpected state.
    ///
    /// ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Note:**
    /// Taking a screenshot and serialising the hierarchy can significantly increase test execution time
    /// (e.g. from 0.1s to 0.3‚Äì0.5s per use). Prefer to use this **only when necessary**, such as:
    /// - In `onFailure` callbacks during `waitFor...`
    /// - Wrapped in conditionals for failed expectations
    ///
    /// Example usage (on failure):
    /// ```swift
    /// try await sut.observer.waitForViewVisible(withID: "buy.button")
    /// // If failure handler is set, snapshot will be captured automatically
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - name: Used as the base name for all attachments (screenshot + hierarchy).
    ///   - lifetime: `XCTAttachment.Lifetime`, defaults to `.keepAlways` for visibility in passed tests.
    ///   - file: Automatically captures the file for XCTFail fallback.
    ///   - line: Automatically captures the line for XCTFail fallback.
